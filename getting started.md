## Introduction
Welcome to the Engineering Park. We are so glad to have you participating in our community.
This guide describes how to get up and running.

## Goal
When you are finished following this guide you will have your scene up and running on one or more parcels of land within the Engineering Park district in Decentraland.

## Prerequisites
If you are reading this, then it is assumed that you have already made contact
via hello@engineeringpark.org and have decided to join our community. If you
have come across this document in some other way, then please make contact
before proceeding.

The very first thing to do is present your idea to the leadership team and
request the required amount of land at the desired location within the district.
You will also need to specify whether you are going to be a non-commercial or a
commercial tennant. The requested land may or may not be available and a
negotiation with the leadership team will be necessary to determine what is
actually possible and what is best for the community. With this in mind, make
sure to visit the district and determine where there is unoocupied or available
land which will suit your needs prior to making your request.

In order to get started, you need to decide whether or not you are going to
update the content of your land by yourself or request the leadership team to do
it for you.

If you are going to update content of your land by yourself then you need an
Ethereum wallet to which the land update rights can be allocated. This is the
wallet which will be used to deploy content to your land and it must be acceible
to the person who will execute the deployment. You also need to have enough ETH
to cover the gas fees for the allocation and future removal of land update
rights (although this does not necessarily need to be in the same wallet and
could even be puchased using Fiat and sent directly to the district's land
management wallet).

If you are going to request the leadership team to update the content of your
land then please do so before proceeding. You will also need a source code
repository (e.g. Github) to store the code for your scene and you will need to
be able to grant read access to this repository to the member of the leadership
team who is assigned to deploy your scene.

**Note:** The [Builder](https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/builder-101/) is a
simple visual editor tool that lets you create and publish Decentraland scenes
but it can only be used for scene creation when you have land update rights
thereby enabling you to update the content of your land by yourself. If the
leadership team is requested to update the content of your land, then you will
need to build your scene using the
[SDK](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/SDK-101/), a powerful tool
that lest you create scenes by writing code.

### Checklist for Prerequisites
